The program checks the sanity of the iso.

The mini-shell supports tty.

Commands help, info and quit are working.

"ls" is working in whatever the current directory is. It doesn't work with
directories as argument.

"cat" is working (but not with absolute/relative path).

"cd" is working but only if the argument contains one directory
(not with multiples, ex : test/foo/bar). "cd -" doesn't work and "cd .."
prints a wrong answer (but works).

"pwd" does work until you try the command "cd .." or "cd -".

"get" is working (but not with absolute/relative path).

"tree" almost works but has some problem with whitespaces.
